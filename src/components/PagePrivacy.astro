      and certain related services. Please be sure to read this entire Privacy Policy before
      using, or submitting information, to this Website.<br />
      <br />
    </div>
    <h2>Policy</h2>
    <div>
      The policy of the Website is to respect and protect the privacy of our users. To

      Privacy Policy to maintain the confidentiality of information provided by you in

      <br />
    </div>
    <h2>Your Consent</h2>
    <div>
      This Privacy Policy sets forth the Website's current policies and practices with
      respect to nonpublic personal information of the users of the Website. By using this

    <h2>Our Commitment to Children's Privacy</h2>
    <div>
      Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. This Website is not
      intended for people under the age of 18. We never collect or maintain information at
      the Website from persons we know to be under age 18, and no part of our Website is
      designed to attract anyone under age 18. We encourage parents to talk to their
      children about their use of the Internet and the information they disclose to
      websites.<br />
      <br />
    </div>
    <h2>Active Information Collection</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        Like many websites, this Website actively collects information from its visitors
        both by asking you specific questions and by permitting you to communicate directly
        with us via e-mail and/or feedback forms. Some of the information that you submit
        may be personally identifiable information (that is, information that can be
        uniquely identified with you, such as your full name, e-mail address, mailing
        address, phone number and sales delivery, billing and credit card information).
      </p>
      <p>
        <br />
         Some areas of this Website may require you to submit information in order for you
        to benefit from the specified features (such as newsletter subscriptions,
        tips/pointers, order processing) or to participate in a particular activity (such as
        other promotions). You will be informed at each information collection point what
        information is required and what information is optional.<br />
        <br />
      </p>
    </div>
    <h2>Disclosure of Information</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        Except as otherwise stated, we may use your information to improve the content of
        our Website, customize the Website to your preferences, communicate information to
        you (if you have requested it), for our marketing and research purposes, and for the
        purposes specified in this Privacy Policy.
      </p>
      <p>
        <br />
         If you provide personally identifiable information to this Website, we may combine
        such information with other actively collected information unless we specify
        otherwise at the point of collection. We may combine your personally identifiable
        information with passively collected information.
      </p>

        <b
          >We may disclose your personally identifiable information to affiliates that agree
          to treat it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. In addition, we may disclose
          your personally identifiable information to third parties, located in the UK
          but only:</b
        ><br />
         to contractors we use to support our business (e.g., fulfillment services,
        technical support, delivery services, and financial institutions), in which case we
        will require such third parties to agree to treat it in accordance with this Privacy
        Policy; in connection with the sale, assignment, or other transfer of the business
        of this site to which the information relates, in which case we will require any
        such buyer to agree to treat it in accordance with this Privacy Policy; or where
        required by applicable laws, court orders, or government regulations. In addition,
        we will make full use of all information acquired through this site that is not in
        personally identifiable form.<br />

    <h2>Security of Information</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        You can be assured that personal information collected through the Website is secure
        and is maintained in a manner consistent with current industry standards. The
        importance of security for all personal information associated with our subscribers
        is of utmost concern to us. Your personal information is protected in several ways.
        Your personal information resides on a secure server that only selected employees
        and contractors have access to via password. In order to most efficiently serve you,
        credit card transactions and order fulfillment are handled by established
        third-party banking, processing agents and distribution institutions. They receive
        the information needed to verify and authorize your credit card or other payment
        information and to process and ship your order. Credit Card information will not be
        shared/sold. All information is transmitted through SSL.
      </p>
      <p>
        <br />
         Unfortunately, no data transmission over the internet or any wireless network can
        be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your
        personal information, you acknowledge that: (a) there are security and privacy
        limitations of the internet which are beyond our control; (b) the security,
        integrity, and privacy of any and all information and data exchanged between you and
        us through this Website cannot be guaranteed; and (c) any such information and data
        may be viewed or tampered with in transit by a third party. Moreover, where you use
        passwords, ID numbers, or other special access features on this Website, it is your
        responsibility to safeguard them.<br />
        <br />
      </p>
    </div>
    <h2>Passive Information Collection</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        As you navigate through a website, certain information can be passively collected
        (that is, gathered without you actively providing the information) using various
        technologies and means, such as Internet Protocol addresses, cookies, Internet tags,
        and navigational data collection.
      </p>
      <p>
        <br />
         This Website may use Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. An IP Address is a number
        assigned to your computer by your Internet service provider so you can access the
        Internet and is generally considered to be non-personally identifiable information,
        because in most cases an IP address is dynamic (changing each time you connect to
        the Internet), rather than static (unique to a particular user's computer). We use
        your IP address to diagnose problems with our server, report aggregate information,
        determine the fastest route for your computer to use in connecting to our Website,
        and administer and improve services to our consumers.
      </p>
      <p>
        <br />
         A "cookie" is a bit of information that a website sends to the web browser that
        helps the site remember information about you and your preferences.
      </p>
      <p>
        <br />
         "Session cookies" are temporary bits of information that are erased once you exit
        your web browser window or otherwise turn your computer off. Session cookies are
        used to improve navigation on websites and to collect aggregate statistical
        information. This Website uses session cookies.
      </p>
      <p>
        <br />
         "Persistent cookies" are more permanent bits of information that are placed on the
        hard drive of your computer and stay there unless you delete the cookie. Persistent
        cookies store information on your computer for a number of purposes, such as
        retrieving certain information you have previously provided (e.g., username),
        helping to determine what areas of the website visitors find most valuable and
        customizing the website based on your preferences. This Website uses persistent
        cookies.
      </p>
      <p>
        <br />
         "Internet tags" (also known as single-pixel GIFs, clear GIFs, invisible GIFs, and
        1-by-1 GIFs) are smaller than cookies and tell the website server information such
        as the IP address and browser type related to the visitor's computer. This Website
        uses Internet tags. "Navigational data" ("log files," "server logs," and
        "clickstream" data) and "Internet Tags" are used for system management, to improve
        the content of the site, market research purposes, and to communicate information to
        visitors. This Website uses navigational data.<br />
        <br />

    <h2>Links</h2>
    <div>
      This Website may contain links to websites of third parties not affiliated with , This
      Privacy Policy will not apply to these third-party websites and the Website is not
      responsible for the privacy practices or the content on any of these other websites,
      even where these third-party sites indicate a special relationship or "partnership"
      with the Website. We do not disclose personally identifiable information to those
      responsible for the linked sites. The linked sites, however, may collect personal
      information from you when you link to their site. This collecting of information is
      not subject to the control of the Website. To ensure the protection of your privacy,
      always review the privacy policies of the sites you visit by linking from this
      Website.<br />

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <div>
      This Privacy Policy may change over time. We will notify you by e-mail to the e-mail
      address associated with your account whenever we make any substantive changes to this
      Privacy Policy. If you do not accept the changed version (for example, if you do not
      approve of a different way that we intend to use personal information) you may let us
      know by letter or e-mail. If you do not respond with any objections, we will assume
      that you consent to changes in the Privacy Policy. Changes will not apply
      retroactively to personal information that was collected before the changes to the
      Privacy Policy, except as may be required by law.<br />
